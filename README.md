# recrtools <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/R-package-orange" alt="R package badge"/> ¬† [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE.md)

**recrtools** is an R package for researchers and land managers working with outdoor recreation data.\
It provides streamlined tools for **cleaning, formatting, and analyzing recreation monitoring data**, including automated processing of **trail counters**, **vehicle counts**, and **visitation datasets**.

The initial release focuses on working with TRAFx ShuttleFiles including reading, cleaning, and correcting timestamps for daylight saving time (DST) as well as basic survey data cleaning and validation tasks.

Future updates will extend support for other data sources and formats used in recreation monitoring and visitor use management.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöÄ Current Features

-   Read and process **TRAFx ShuttleFiles** into tidy data frames:

    -   `counts` ‚Äì hourly count data
    -   `header` ‚Äì download metadata

-   Automatically correct timestamps for **Daylight Saving Time (DST)** shifts

-   Process **single files or entire folders**

-   Specify **time zones** or use the system default

-   Includes **example ShuttleFiles** for quick testing and reproducibility

-   **Dictionary-based recoding** for survey ‚ÄúOther‚Äù responses

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üì¶ Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # if not already installed
remotes::install_github("crleslie/recrtools")
library(recrtools)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìù Example Usage

### Read a single ShuttleFile

``` r
example_file <- system.file("extdata", "ShuttleFile_EXAMPLE.TXT", package = "recrtools")
data <- read_shuttlefile(example_file, return = "both")

counts <- data$counts
header <- data$header
```

### Batch process multiple files

``` r
data_folder <- "data/trafx_downloads/"
data <- read_shuttlefile(data_folder, return = "both")

counts <- data$counts
header <- data$header
```

### Adjust timestamps for daylight saving time

``` r
correct_dst("data/trafx_downloads/", direction = "begin", year = 2024)
```

### Dictionary-based recoding for survey ‚ÄúOther‚Äù responses

``` r
library(dplyr)

survey <- tibble(
  activity_select = c("Biking", "Other", "Other", "Running", "Other"),
  activity_other_text = c(NA, "mountain biking", "trail run with dog", NA, "skateboarding")
)

# Define a dictionary mapping categories to keywords
dict <- list(
  biking  = c("bike", "biking", "cycling"),
  running = c("run", "running")
)

# Apply recoding
survey <- survey %>%
  mutate(activity_recoded = recode_by_dict(activity_select, activity_other_text, dict))

survey
```

| activity_select | activity_other_text | activity_recoded |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Biking          | NA                  | biking           |
| Other           | mountain biking     | biking           |
| Other           | trail run with dog  | running          |
| Running         | NA                  | running          |
| Other           | skateboarding       | other            |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß≠ Roadmap

Planned additions include:

-   Functions for **aggregating and validating visitation data**
-   Standardized tools for **vehicle and trail count summaries**
-   **QA/QC utilities** for survey and recreation monitoring workflows
-   Support for other common field data formats and sensors

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üõ† Folder Structure Recommendation

Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) rather than simply using base R will greatly improve your user experience. RStudio is popular IDE - it is the one I personally use - and allows you to create and manage RStudio projects. A project is a collection of files for an analysis or data task that are organized into a single folder, with a `NAME_OF_PROJECT.Rproj` file. When you open a project, RStudio sets the working directory to the root folder of the project and opens the project environment that organizes all your project objects (variables, functions, etc.) during a session. 

Setting the working directory to the root folder allows you to define the file path for reading and writing data relative to the root, rather than required the full absolute path all the way back to your drive letter. This makes it much easier to move your project around, open it from multiple computers, and collaborate with other colleagues if you are working from a shared file server environment. 

To organize your project files, I highly recommend adopting a standard folder structure, such as the one below. This structure is based on one of my favorite article of all time - for both content and the title: [Good enough practices in scientific computing (Wilson et al., 2017)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)
